# UserInterface
JDBC based Information retrieval and Visual Analysis system

The JDBC based information retrieval system is
used to retrieve information from the database
based on the input provided by the users in the
Graphical User Interface. The GUI also provides
the visual analysis of the data via Tableau
workbook which is accessed by the Java GUI
itself. This Visualization details the information
present in the data in visually interactive form
which can be used to estimate traffic violations in
the U.S depending on several different aspects
like race, gender and state where most violations
occur. This visualization can be used for public
safety and can also be used to ensure strict
enforcement of laws in terms of traffic violations.
